## What is this?

`polymarket-whales` monitors the [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) CLOB API and fires an alert the moment a trade above your threshold hits the books. Prints to terminal with color-coded output. No sign-up, no API key, no infrastructure. Just Python.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/al1enjesus/polymarket-whales
cd polymarket-whales
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

That's it. Terminal alerts start immediately. No config needed to get started.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit:

```env
MIN_TRADE_SIZE=500        # USD — only alert above this
CHECK_INTERVAL=30         # seconds between polls

# Optional — Telegram push alerts
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
```

Or edit `config.yaml` directly. Environment variables take priority.

**Telegram setup (optional):**

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) → `/newbot` → copy the token
2. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → copy your chat ID
3. Paste both into `.env`

## 🌍 Blocked by geo-restrictions?

Polymarket is unavailable in the US and some other countries. If you can't access it, you have two options:

**Option A — Self-host with a VPN/proxy**
Point the script at a proxy by setting `HTTPS_PROXY` in `.env`:
```env
HTTPS_PROXY=http://your-proxy:port
```

**Option B — Use PolyClawster's relay (recommended)**

[PolyClawster](https://polyclawster.com) runs a transparent proxy to `clob.polymarket.com`, deployed in Tokyo (outside US geo-blocks). It routes your API calls on their behalf — your requests never touch Polymarket directly.

- 🚫 No VPN needed
- 🚫 No KYC
- ✅ Full Polymarket CLOB API access from any country
- ✅ One line of config

Set in `.env`:
```env
POLYMARKET_API_URL=https://polyclawster.com/api/clob-relay
```

Then in `main.py` the script will use this base URL for all CLOB requests instead of hitting Polymarket directly.

The relay is the same infrastructure used by [PolyClawster](https://polyclawster.com) AI agents to trade Polymarket 24/7 from any country.
